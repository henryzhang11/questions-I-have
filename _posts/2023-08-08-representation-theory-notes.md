We have $\oplus_V\mathbb{Z}_{\chi_V}=\mathbb{Z}[t_i^{\pm 1}]^{\text{Weil group}}$ for $U(n)$ due to the following theorem:

**Theorem 3.1** For any dominant weight $\mu$ of $U(n)$, there exists $V^\mu$ so that $\chi_{V^\mu}(t)=t^\mu+\sum_{\eta\in\text{cone of negative roots}}k_{\eta}t^{\mu+\eta}$.

**Proof:** We first consider and $\infty$-dimensional representation of $\mathfrak{gl}(n)\supset\mathfrak{u}(n)$. It has to have a vector $v_\mu$ so that $t\cdot v_\mu=t^\mu v_\mu$, $E_{ii}v_\mu=\mu_iv_\mu$, and $E_{ij}v_\mu=0$ for $i\<\ j$ because $E_{ij}v_\mu$ is a vector of weight greater than $\mu$ (I am not convinced of the existence of such a $v_\mu$). We construct a module $M(\mu)$ generated by the relations $E_iiv_\mu=\mu_iv_\mu$ and $E_{ij}v_\mu=0$ if $i\<\ j$. Let $U(\mathfrak{gl}(n))=\mathbb{C}<E_{ij}>/\{xy-yx\}=[xy]$ be the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$, then $U(\mathfrak{g}(n))$ has a basis consisting of monomials in $E_{ij}$ ordered arbitrarily by the PBW theorem. We have $M(\mu)=U(\mathfrak{gl}(n))\cdot v_\mu/\{E_{ii}v_\mu=\mu_iv_\mu,E_{ij}v_\mu=0\text{ for }i\<\ j\}$, which equals the span of terms like $E_{53}E_{74}...v_\mu$, arbitrary product of $E_{ij}$ for $i>j$ ordered arbitrarily. Let $M\subset M(\mu)$ be a submodule of $M(\mu)$, then $M$ either contains $v_\mu$, in which case $M=M(\mu)$, or $M$ doesn't contain $v_\mu$. Let $L(\mu)$ be the union of all submodules of $M(\mu)$, then $M$ either contains $v_\mu$, in which case $M=M(\mu)$, or $M$ doesn't contain $v_\mu$. Let $L(\mu)$ be the union of all submodules of $M$ that doesn't contain $v_\mu$, then $M(\mu)/L(\mu)$ is irreducible. Since all irreducible representations of $U(n)$ are finite dimensional, we have a desired representation with the specific character. On the other hand, we could directly see the finite dimensionality of $V_\mu$ by considering the function $\phi:G\to\mathbb{C}$ taking $g$ to the coefficient of $v_\mu$ in $g\cdot v_\mu$. Let $u^+$ be an upper triangular matrices with $1$s on the diagonal and $u^-$ be the set of lower triangular matrices with $1$s on the diagonal. We have $\phi(u^-gu^+)=\phi(g)$ and $\phi(t)=t^\mu$. By Gauss decomposition, this function is fixed on all 

**Remark:** We could work out the finite dimensionality of $M(\mu)/L(\mu)$ in another way:

**Corollary 1.1** $\oplus_V\mathbb{Z}_{\chi_V}=\mathbb{Z}[t_i^{\pm 1}=\mathbb{Z}[t_i^{\pm 1}]^{\text{Weil group}}$ 

**Corollary 1.2** In principle, we concompute $\chi_V(t)$ by Gram-Schmidt following the formulas $(\chi_{V^\mu}(t),\chi_{V^\mu}(t))_{L^2(G)}=0$ for $\nu<\mu$. 

Since $SU(2)$ is a $3$-sphere and $T_{SU(2)}$ is a big circle on $SU(2)$ we have $L^2(SU(2)^{\text{conjugation}})=L^2(T,sin^2\phi d\phi)=L^2(T,\frac{1}{w}(1-z^2)(1-\overline{z}^2)\frac{dz}{2\pi iz})$. 

**Theorem** (Weyl Integration Formula) Given a compact Lie group $G$, a conjugation-constant function $f$ ($f(g^{-1}hg)=f(h)$), the Harr measure $\mu$ on $G$, the maximal torus $T$ of $G$, the Weyl group $W=N(T)/T$, we have $$\int_G fd\mu=\frac{1}{|W|}\int_Tf(t)\prod_{\text{roots }\alpha}(t^\alpha-1)\frac{dt}{2\pi i t}$$. 

**Proof:** We consider the map $c: G/T\times T\to G$ defined as $c(g, t)=gtg^{-1}$. Locally this map is a homeomorphism and
